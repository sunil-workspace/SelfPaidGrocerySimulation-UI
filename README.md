# Self Paid Grocery System:
# Description of the Project:
This project is a web-based application for customers who would like to access self-checkout option. This application will reduce the waiting time and also the cost investment, as it will take less space. This project adopts a use-case driven object-oriented approach to develop a system to support the simulation of a self-paid grocery on a particular day based on purchased items by a customer.  
In Self-Paid Grocery Simulation, the customer with membership can login with member ID to get discount on items and a customer without membership can login as a guest (without discount). The customer can select the items he/she wants to purchase choosing the images of items provided. The customer can navigate using the buttons (A-Z) provided based on the alphabetical order of items. The customer can see the list of items selected with price and item name select in a table format. Once the selection of items is completed, the customer can verify the items from the list displayed in the table. Then, the customer can proceed for payment. The customer can select any payment options like cash/credit-card/debit-card/gift-card and enter the cards details asked and proceed to checkout option. On successful purchase, a receipt of the purchased items is generated and the customer can print the receipt. Also a pdf copy of receipt is sent to the registered email as an attachment.
